Website for raiding small Twitch.tv streamers. 
Build with Vue, Node, Express and Socket.io. 

The website waits a specific amount of seconds and then displays an embedded Twitch.tv stream with a small number of views. The website displays how many users are waiting for a raid and a countdown to the raid. Twitch.tv is continuously scanned for streams under x-amount of viewers, which are added to a container to pick from.
